# Product Context - ThinkAndTalk

## What ThinkAndTalk is
ThinkAndTalk helps creators turn messy ideas into spoken-friendly scripts.
The focus is not writing. The focus is thinking clearly and talking naturally.

## Core problem
Creators often:
- Know the topic but freeze when writing
- Sound stiff when reading scripts
- Struggle with hooks, pacing, and CTAs
- Lose consistency across platforms

## Key differentiation
- Voice-first onboarding to capture tone and intent quickly
- Spoken-language optimization (rhythm, breath, emphasis)
- Audience-aware scripts with clear takeaways
- Platform-specific pacing (TikTok, YouTube, Reels, podcasts)
- Progressive personalization over time
- News-aware context to keep scripts timely

## Target users
- Content creators
- Educators
- Influencers
- Experts building authority or selling knowledge

## What ThinkAndTalk is NOT
- A generic AI text generator
- A prompt playground
- A copywriting tool for ads

## Product principles
- Always edit for natural speech and clarity
- Keep the user's voice and intent intact
- Make structure visible (hook, body, CTA)
- Prefer concise, usable output over long prose

## Success signals
- Users publish within 15 minutes of opening the app
- Scripts read smoothly with minimal edits
- Higher completion rate across planned content series

## Constraints
- Lovable runtime only (no custom infrastructure)
