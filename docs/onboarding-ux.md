# Onboarding UX - ThinkAndTalk

## Goal
Help the user sound like themselves in under 4 minutes.

## Flow
1. Welcome and value promise
2. Creator profile (topic focus, expertise level)
3. Audience profile (who, age range, gender split, desired outcome)
4. Platform and duration (format, target length)
5. Speaking style (tone, pacing, energy)
6. Content goal (teach, persuade, entertain, sell)
7. Advanced preferences (optional)

## Inputs captured
- Creator voice adjectives (pick 3-5)
- Typical audience sophistication
- Call-to-action type
- Content cadence (series vs one-off)

## UX principles
- Choices over typing whenever possible
- Cards, sliders, and toggles
- Always show progress
- Skip is always allowed
- Default to the shortest path, offer depth later
